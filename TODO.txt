-Include Email confirmation for registration (5 marks)

-Publish website so we can register for reCaptcha keys. An alternative could be to just add an "I am not a robot" checkbox. 

-Need "most followed" and "most active contributor" links.

-Create 2 seperate Admin pages for Manage Users (what we currently have) and Main Page (just to show the charts)
