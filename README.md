Notes from Tom:


Notes from Curtis:
- I've been adding TODO notes to the code as I go so I don't forget about doing something later.
  Feel free to add some as you go as well.

- Thinking about the Admin pages.  Since there's two pages (User Admin and Content Admin), I wonder how to
  map the site out.  Ideally, the Admin link at the top could be a dropdown menu (don't know how to code
  that though).  Alternately, it could link ContentAdmin which contains a further link to UserAdmin.  WDYT?
