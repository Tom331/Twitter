-Spent hours trying to filter the posts displyed when clicking the follow links on the member page but still no luck. 
For some reason it looks like every post ever made is displayed. You can see in my URLDATA test above the table that
it does select the correct userID (according to the/# in follow link) but it still doesn't filter to only those posts. 

-Added Picture and Username to DeleteUser
-Added Pictures to Admin page
-Member page now focuses to textbox (added script at bottom of head section)
-Added "tableBackground" class at bottom of content/themes/Site.css for posts styling.
